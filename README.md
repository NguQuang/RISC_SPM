# RISC-SPM
>A final project of the course "Digital Design using VHDL"
## Overview
Reduced instruction-set computers (RISC) are designed to have a small set of instructions that execute in short clock cycles, with a small number of cycles per instruction. RISC machines are optimized to achieve efficient pipelining of their instruction streams. The machine also serves as a starting point for developing architectural variants and a more robust instruction set. Designers make high-level tradeoffs in selecting an architecture that serves an
application. Once an architecture has been selected, a circuit that has sufficient performance (speed) must be synthesized. Hardware description languages (HDLs) play a key role in this process by modeling the system and serving as a descriptive medium
that can be used by a synthesis tool.

RISC-SPM or Reduced Instruction Set Computer Store Program Machine consists of three functional units :
1. Processing Unit ( Processor )
2. Controll Unit ( Controller )
3. Memory Unit ( RAM )

Program instructions and data are stored in memory

Instructions are fetched from memory synchronously, decoded and executed to : 
- Operate on data with ALU
- Change the contents of storage registers
- Change the content of the program counter (PC), instruction register (IR) and the address register (ADD_R)
- Change the content of memory
- Retrieve data and instructions from memory
- Control the movement of data on the system busses

The Program Counter (PC) contains the address of the next instruction to be executed

The Instruction Register (IR) contains the instruction that currently being executed

The address register (Add_R) contains the address of the memory location that will be addressed next by a read or write operation.

The Overall Architecture of a simple RISC-SPM is shown below

## Processing Unit
The processor includes registers, datapaths, control lines, and an ALU capable of performing arithmetic and logic operations on its operands, subject to the opcode held in the instruction register. A multiplexer, Mux_1, determines the source of data that is bound for Bus_1, and a second mux, Mux_2, determines the source of data bound for Bus_2. The input datapaths to Mux_1 are from four internal general-purpose registers (R0, R1, R2, R3), and from the PC. The contents of Bus_1 can be steered to the ALU, to memory, or to Bus_2 (via Mux_2). The input datapaths to Mux_2 are from the ALU, Mux_1, and the memory unit. Thus, an instruction can be fetched from memory, placed on Bus_2, and loaded into the instruction register. A word of data can be fetched from memory, and steered to a general-purpose register or to the operand register (Reg_Y) prior to an operation of the ALU. The result of an ALU operation can be placed on Bus_2, loaded into a register, and subsequently transferred to memory. A dedicated register (Reg_Z) holds a flag indicating that the result of an ALU operation is 0.

## Arithmetic Logic Unit
For the purposes of this example, the ALU has two operand datapaths, data_1 and data_2, and its instruction set is limited to only 4 instructions, that is :
- ADD : Adds the datapaths to form data_1 + data_2
- SUB : Subtracts the datapaths to form data_1 - data_2
- AND : Takes the bitwise-and of the datapaths. data_1 & data_2
- NOT : Takes the bitwise Boolean complement of data_1

## Control Unit
### Functions of the control unit:
1. Determine when to load registers
2. Select the path of data through the multiplexers
3. Determine when data should be written to memory
4. Control the three-state busses in the architecture.

### Control Signals :

- Load_Add_R : Loads the address register
- Load_PC :  Loads Bus_2to the program counter
- Load_IR : Loads Bus_2 to the instruction register
- Inc_PC : Increments the program counter
- Sel_Bus_1_Mux : Selects among the Program_Counter, R0, R1, R2, and R3 to drive Bus_1
- Sel_Bus_2_Mux : Selects among Alu_out, Bus_1, and memory to drive Bus_2
- Load_R0 : Loads general purpose register R0
- Load_R1 : Loads general purpose register R1
- Load_R2 : Loads general purpose register R2
- Load_R3 : Loads general purpose register R3
- Load_Reg_Y : Loads Bus_2 to the register Reg_Y
- Load_Reg_Z : Stores output of ALU in register Reg_Z
- write : Loads Bus_1 into the SRAM memory

## Memory Unit
For simplicity, the memory unit of the machine is modeled as an array of D flip-flops that form a **256 bytes** RAM
